# Project Management

Project Management is a user-friendly project management application that helps you stay organized and on top of your tasks. With this app, you can easily create and manage projects, complete with titles, descriptions, and due dates. Each project has its own dedicated page where you can add sub-tasks to break down the work and keep track of progress. If a project is no longer needed, you can also delete it along with any associated sub-tasks. Simplify your project management process with SimpleProject Manager!
